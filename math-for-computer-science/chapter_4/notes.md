We discoverd that the system has the pattern of letting the first jug have some integer times a - some integer times b, so we create this formula which is going to be our invariant for this problem:

s . a + t . b

We use positive signal here because it is a linear combination and any negative t will negate the b part of this equation.

## Linear combination

A linear combination of elements (like numbers or vectors) is an expression formed by multiplying each element by a scalar and then adding the results.

Scalars are just numbers (integers in this specific case) that scale (multiply) the jug capacities a and b.
