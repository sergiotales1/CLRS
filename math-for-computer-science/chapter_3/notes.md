# Well Ordering Principle

how do we know that the fraction m / n for m, n being any of the positive integers can be reduced to m′ and n′? (lowest terms)

Remember z+ = positive integers

# Induction - page 49

Induction proof is a technique used to prove that P(n) is true for all non negative integers.

Just like knocking over a line of dominoes... if P(n) then P(n + 1)

## Base case

Show that the statement P(n) holds for the smallest number (n = 0 | n = 1). Basically knocking over the first domino.

## Inductive hypothesis

Assume that P(k) holds where k > n (n = 0 | n = 1), then prove that P(k + 1) is true using the assumption that P(k) holds. This step shows that if any domino falls, the next will also fall.
