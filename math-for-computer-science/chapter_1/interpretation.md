## ✅ What is an **Interpretation**?

An **interpretation** in logic is a way of giving **meaning** to the symbols in a formula.
It tells us **what the formula is talking about** — and therefore whether it is **true or false** in that specific case.

### 🧩 More Formally, an interpretation includes:

1. **A domain of discourse** ($D$)
   → The set of things the variables can refer to
   → Example: all people, all numbers, all cities, etc.

2. **An assignment for predicate symbols**
   → What does $P(x, y)$ actually mean?
   → Example: $P(x, y)$ could mean “$x$ is taller than $y$” or “$x$ likes $y$”

3. _(Optional)_ Meanings for function symbols or constants (if they appear in the formula)

### 🧠 Example Interpretation:

Let’s say you have the predicate formula:

$$
\forall x \exists y \, P(x, y)
$$

What it means depends on the **interpretation**.

#### Interpretation 1:

- Domain: all **people**
- $P(x, y)$: “$x$ knows $y$”

Then the formula means:

> “Everyone knows someone.” — This could be **true** or **false**, depending on the world you're imagining.

#### Interpretation 2:

- Domain: all **natural numbers**
- $P(x, y)$: “$x < y$”

Then the formula means:

> “For every number $x$, there exists a number $y$ such that $x < y$” → **True**

So the **truth of a formula depends on the interpretation**.

## 🧭 Why Interpretations Matter

Because predicate logic is **more abstract** than propositional logic, we need interpretations to:

- **Assign meaning** to the formula
- **Determine truth** in a given case
- **Test validity** by asking: “Is this formula true under **every possible interpretation**?”
