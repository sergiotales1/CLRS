# Axioms

An axiom is a starting rule that everyone agrees is true without needing proof. It’s like the basic "common sense" foundation for building more complicated ideas.

#### **Real-Life Analogy:**

Imagine you’re playing a game (like chess). The rules say:

- _"A pawn moves forward one square."_
- _"The king can move one square in any direction."_

These are the **axioms** of chess. You don’t prove why pawns move that way—you just accept it as the starting point. From there, you figure out strategies (theorems) based on those rules.

## Theorems

A theorem is a conclusion of a proof and that proof uses axioms and already-proven propositions as building blocks.

### Logical deduction

An inference rule is sound when all the antecedents are true and the conclusion as well, in every case the antecedents are true.

The book shows a method to solve implications propositions using factoring and doing assumptions.

After factoring we can get three terms that are x, 2−x , and 2+x. All of them are nonnegative for numbers between 0 and 2, which is our P that we assumed to be true.

# Deviation

The deviation of a sequence of values refers to how much the values differ from their average (mean)

### Purpose

It can give us a summary of how spread out the values in the sequence are.

# Proof IFF

When proving an IFF you can use a chain of IFFs, assuming P is true until you reach an iff that asserts that Q is also true.

# lowest terms

A fraction is in its lowest terms when both the numerator and denominator are in it simplest form, where they don't share any common factor besides the number 1.

# square root 2 is irrational

We can prove this at the page 32 and it's interesting because we start making multiple assumptions about the natural characteristics of a rational number, one of them is that every rational number has its lowest term expression and root 2 doesn't, this is the contradiction that proved that root 2 is an irrational

PS: in order to make a proof, you can rely on the nuances of your proof.

Look from above.
What do we have?
What free information can we gather with we have?
And these questions will help you prove the statements.

# Cardinality

The cardinality of a set is defined as the number of elements in a mathematical set. It can be finite or infinite. For example, the cardinality of the set A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} is equal to 6

|A| is read as "the cardinality of set A"

|{0, 1, 2}| = 3

# Sets

∪ (Union) -> This represents the union between two sets.

∩ (Intersection) -> This represents the common elements shared between two sets
