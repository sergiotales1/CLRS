# Axioms

An axiom is a starting rule that everyone agrees is true without needing proof. It’s like the basic "common sense" foundation for building more complicated ideas.

#### **Real-Life Analogy:**

Imagine you’re playing a game (like chess). The rules say:

- _"A pawn moves forward one square."_
- _"The king can move one square in any direction."_

These are the **axioms** of chess. You don’t prove why pawns move that way—you just accept it as the starting point. From there, you figure out strategies (theorems) based on those rules.

## Theorems

A theorem is a conclusion of a proof and that proof uses axioms and already-proven propositions as building blocks.

### Logical deduction

An inference rule is sound when all the antecedents are true and the conclusion as well, in every case the antecedents are true.

The book shows a method to solve implications propositions using factoring and doing assumptions.

After factoring we can get three terms that are x, 2−x , and 2+x. All of them are nonnegative for numbers between 0 and 2, which is our P that we assumed to be true.
