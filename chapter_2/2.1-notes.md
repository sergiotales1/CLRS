# 2.1 Insertion sort

**Key** -> These are the actual values (numbers, in this case) that determine the order of the sorted sequence. For example, if you're sorting student records by their ID numbers, the ID numbers are the keys.

**Satellite data** -> the data that comes along with the key e.g.: student name, student address and etc.

**Record** -> joint of both

**loop invariant** -> is a condition or property that remains true after each iteration

**subarray** -> a contiguous portion of the array. e.g.:

```py
arr = [1, 3, 6, 2]
arrSubArray = [1, 2]
```

###

It starts from two because the first value is already sorted since we will just move the later values, if greater than the first then it goes to the right of the first, if it's less than the first, it goes to the left

from A[1 : i - 1] we have the items already sorted

from A[i : n] is not yet sorted

clutter -> disorder
