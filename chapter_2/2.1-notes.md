# 2.1 Insertion sort

**Key** -> These are the actual values (numbers, in this case) that determine the order of the sorted sequence. For example, if you're sorting student records by their ID numbers, the ID numbers are the keys.

**Satellite data** -> the data that comes along with the key e.g.: student name, student address and etc.

**Record** -> joint of both

**loop invariant** -> is a condition or property that remains true after each iteration

**subarray** -> a contiguous portion of the array. e.g.:

```py
arr = [1, 3, 6, 2]
arrSubArray = [1, 2]
```

# algorithm explanation

```py
  def insertion_sort(A, n):
    for i in range(1, n): # 1
      key = A[i] # 2
      j = i - 1 # 3
      while j >= 0 and A[j] > key: # 4
        A[j + 1] = A[j]
        j -= 1
      A[j + 1] = key
    return A
```

1 - We need to loop through the array to sort it and we choose to use a for loop for this task

2- create a variable to store the value of A[i], we do it because in the next steps we'll be moving values around what could make we lose A[i]'s value

3- we need to have a different value based on the index in order to compare the items and find the correct order for them

4- To insert the key into its correct position in the sorted portion of the array, we use a while loop that continues as long as j >= 0 and A[j] > key. This allows us to scan backwards through the sorted subarray A[0 : i], shifting elements one position to the right to make space for the key. Once we find the correct position, we insert the key at A[j + 1].

from A[1 : i - 1] we have the items already sorted

from A[i : n] is not yet sorted
