### Array Orders

- **Strictly Increasing**: Each element is **greater than** the previous one.
  Example: `[1, 2, 3, 4]`
  Duplicates **not allowed**.

- **Non-Decreasing (Weakly Increasing)**: Each element is **greater than or equal to** the previous one.
  Example: `[1, 2, 2, 3]`
  Duplicates **allowed**.

- **Strictly Decreasing**: Each element is **less than** the previous one.
  Example: `[5, 4, 3, 2]`
  Duplicates **not allowed**.

- **Non-Increasing (Weakly Decreasing)**: Each element is **less than or equal to** the previous one.
  Example: `[5, 4, 4, 3]`
  Duplicates **allowed**.

The **relative order** of an array refers to the **original positions of elements with respect to each other**, particularly when the values are equal or when elements are moved around (e.g., during sorting or filtering operations).

# Relative order

> The **relative order** of elements in an array is the order they appeared **originally**, **with respect to each other**, before any operation like sorting, filtering, or grouping.
