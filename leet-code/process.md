# Understand Why are we using what

# Linked list

Linked list is a non-contiguous data structure made of nodes that point to the next or prev nodes.

# Linked Lists and React Fiber Tree

I found this similarity with React Fiber. There we point to siblings, parents and child, just like a linked list does, we can traverse all the three only by having a single element of it.

## Bitwise

Bitwise operators can perform logic, comparison, math and transformations at the binary level. (0s and 1s)

# Algorithms

We need to memorize binary search and dfs

## dfs

Deep-first search? what is this ?
