## 1.2 Algorithms as a technology

### 1.2-1

> Give an example of an application that requires algorithmic content at the application level, and discuss the function of the algorithms involved.

E-commerce. We can get user's preferences and render items aligned with them on the main page so it will be more easily bought. If we have more than one store or warehouse we need to define an algorithm that will calculate the shortest path between the product bought and the customer.

### 1.2-2

> Suppose that for inputs of size n on a particular computer, insertion sort runs in 8n² steps and merge sort runs in 64 n lg n steps. For which values of n does insertion sort beat merge sort?

8n² < 64n log n

### 1.2-3

> What is the smallest value of n such that an algorithm whose running time is 100n² runs faster than an algorithm whose running time is 2n on the same machine?

100n² < 2^n

n ≥ 15
