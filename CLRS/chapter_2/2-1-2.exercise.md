At the start of each iteration the sum variable equals the sum of the values from A[1 : i - 1].

**Initialization**: at the start of the first iteration (i = 1), the invariant refers to A[1 : 0], which is an empty subarray, so the sum of that subarray is 0, matching the initial value of sum

**Maintenance**: Assume that at the start of iteration i, the invariant holds â€” that is, sum equals the sum of the subarray A[1 : i - 1].
In the body of the loop, A[i] is added to sum. As a result, at the start of the next iteration (i + 1), sum equals the sum of A[1 : i].
This matches the invariant for iteration i + 1, so the invariant is maintained from one iteration to the next.

**Termination**: when the loop stops we can assure by the invariant that the variable sum now equals the summation of all elements from the following subarray a[1 : n]

```cpp
SUM-ARRAY(A, n)
  sum = 0
  for i = 1 to n
    sum = sum + A[i]
return sum
```
