# exercise pseudocode

```cpp
LINEAR-SEARCH(A, x)
  for i = 1 to A.length
    if A[i] == x
      return i
  return NIL
```

**Loop invariant**: At the start of each iteration the value of X has not been found in the subarray A[1, i - 1].

**Initialization**: At the start of the first iteration, i = 1, so the subarray A[1 : 0] is empty. Since no elements have been checked yet, the invariant holds true.

**Maintenance**: If the loop continues to the next iteration, it means that x ≠ A[i]. Since the invariant holds true at the start of the iteration, it also means that x is not equal to any value in the subarray A[1 … i].

**Termination**: When the loop stops it means that either the value is found in the array from A[1, i] at the position i, or the value is not there at all and the linear search had successfully researched through the whole array.
