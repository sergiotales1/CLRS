## 1.1 Algorithms

### 1.1-1

> Describe your own real-world example that requires sorting. Describe one that requires finding the shortest distance between two points.

- Sorting: When learning new words we can sort them by the difficulty in order to learn the easiest ones first.
- Two points: When you're planning to travel between states, you might look for the shortest route in order to spend less on fuel.

### 1.1-2

> Other than speed, what other measures of efficiency might you need to consider in a real-world setting?

- Accuracy: How close is the result to the expected output ?
- Versatility: How adaptable is the solution? Does it work well for every instance of the problem?

### 1.1-3

> Select a data structure that you have seen, and discuss its strengths and limitations.

Array → An array allows you to store multiple values of the same type, which increases the flexibility and efficiency of your code.
As for its limitations, arrays typically allow duplicate values and require all elements to be of the same data type.

### 1.1-4

> How are the shortest-path and traveling-salesperson problems given above similar? How are they different?

Both involve finding the optimal paths minimizing the distance. But the traveling-salesperson deals with more than two points and requires the route to pass through every node at least once and return to the started point, adding more complexity.

### 1.1-5

> Suggest a real-world problem in which only the best solution will do. Then come up with one in which “approximately” the best solution is good enough.

1. I have an important exam in two weeks and i'm not so sure if i'm prepared to get a good grade on it. So the best solution would be to study for around 6 hours per day in order to go well during the exam.

2. There's a fan that makes too much noise and doesn't cool well so the solution would be to throw it off and buy a new one.

### 1.1-6

> Describe a real-world problem in which sometimes the entire input is available before you need to solve the problem, but other times the input is not entirely available in advance and arrives over time.

1. Every week, I have household chores to complete, such as washing the dishes and taking out the trash. Usually, I know in advance what chores I’ll need to do throughout the week. However, sometimes I get unexpected visits, which means I have to clean more than usual and wash extra dishes.
